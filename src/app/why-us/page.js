                  At Mie Ride, we understand that transportation is about your
                  time, your plans, your comfort, and your peace of mind. We've
                  built our service around real human needs – for both
                  passengers and drivers.

                  No one likes surprises when it comes to transportation. That's
                  why we've created a system with fixed pricing that stays the
                  same regardless of traffic or weather conditions. Book in
                  advance, know what you'll pay, and plan your budget
                  accordingly. For drivers, this means consistent earnings
                  without the frustration of fluctuating fares.

                <p className="">
                  Life rarely follows a perfectly straight line. Add multiple
                  stops to your journey, schedule return trips in one booking,
                  or modify your plans as needed. Drivers can set availability
                  for up to five cities and choose when they want to
                  work–because we believe transportation should adapt to your
                  life, not the other way around. Your ride share experience
                  should be as flexible as your day-to-day plans.
